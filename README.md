# Where are the IT Jobs today in Sweden?

## Background
I got laid off last year. I started to look for jobs this year without luck. 10+ years mobile development experience, last job at Spotify, Nope! That makes me reflect,  where are the jobs nowadays? I understand that market is tough considering the global recession, but 1 tech job with over 100 applications, that's frustrating! 

I start to think, a lot of you, are like me, sitting in front of the computer, sending out hundreds of apllications without luck. I thought I need to understand where the IT jobs are nowadays, so that I can have a better chance. 


## How Does The Script Work? 
I wrote a python script, taking content from the arbetsförmedlingen, platsbanken (filter: Stockholm, IT), saved it as a text file. In my python script, I set a few common IT keywords to check what jobs are listed most frequent. Then I visualize it as a chart.

## How to reuse the script?
 For you to resue the script in your market, change the content in the textfile, change the search keyboards in the python script. All the functions shoud work properly. 


## Limitation of the script
Initially, I would like to scrape the dynamic content from the arbetsförmedlingen, platsbanken, the data was fetched by javascript, I could not get the real content, but just some variable names, like ids. If you want to spend time into making this work, that's great. It is a just an adhoc experiment for me. I hope this can help me and others.
